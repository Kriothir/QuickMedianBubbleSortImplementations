How To Use

1. To create an array select option 1 and then type in the desired size of an array. This will randomly generate an array that needs to be sorted with the specified size
2. Options 2 and 3 work the same way as option 1 except it creates a sorted array (decrease or increase).
3. With option 4 you can check if the array was properly generated
4. Then you can choose one of three sorting algorithms to sort your array. It will display how long it took. With option 4, you can check if the array was properly sorted by your chosen algorithm
